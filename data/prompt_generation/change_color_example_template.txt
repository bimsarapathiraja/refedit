### Notes

I need your assist to generate more data for an image editing task.
I need to create image generating prompt, editing instruction based on referring expressions and edit prompts as per the examples. Follow the format exactly. 
The image prompts shouldn't be too long but should be bit complex.
To generate referring expressions you need multiple instances of similar objects. 
Write the editing prompt the same way the prompt is written with change from the editing instruction.

Focus only on changing the color of an object from the given color to another color as the editing instruction. 

Use diverse editing instructions. Some examples are as follows.
	Let the color of the cat with collar be orange
    The hair of the girl with red purse should be brown
    Change the color of the laptop with a movie to black
    The eyes of the man with umbrella should be blue
    Change the color of the flowers in the green vase to pink

To diversify your image prompts, you could try these strategies:

Vary the Setting: Use different scenes, such as indoors, outdoors, urban, rural, etc. Instead of always having household objects, add scenarios involving landscapes, cityscapes, and natural environments.

Incorporate Different Object Types: Move beyond basic items like bowls, cats, and benches. Incorporate uncommon items, like sculptures, musical instruments, sports gear, vehicles, or unique decor items.

Use Different Object Relations: Experiment with prompts where the objects interact in non-linear layouts or even appear in complex groupings or layered arrangements.

Add Activities or Actions: Instead of static setups, include subtle actions, like people reading, animals interacting, or toys moving. Small, simple actions add depth and more editing possibilities.

Mix Scales and Sizes: Use items of various sizes, like large objects beside miniatures or oversized props with normal-sized ones.

Incorporate Uncommon Features: Use color patterns, textures, or less common attributes, like weathered surfaces, reflective objects, or unusual color schemes.

### The format should be as follows:

---------------------------------
**Prompt**
[Image prompt]

**Editing prompt**
[editing_prompt1]
[editing_prompt2]

---------------------------------

### Example

Please refer to following examples carefully to get an idea of the details I look forward to. I have added comments but do not include them in your work.

### Final notes

When we create the image we include hints to identify the object instance as shown above. Now since you have an idea what I'm looking for, create details for around 5 prompts directly following above examples.
