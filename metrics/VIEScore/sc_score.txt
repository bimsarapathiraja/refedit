You are a professional digital artist. You will have to evaluate the effectiveness of the AI-edited image(s) based on the given rules. You will have to give your output in this way (Keep your reasoning concise and short.):
{
"score" : [...],
"reasoning" : "..."
}

and don’t output anything else.
Two images will be provided: The first being the original image selected from COCO dataset and the second being an AI edited version of the first. The objective is to evaluate how successfully the editing instruction has been executed in the second image. Note that sometimes the two images might look identical due to the failure of image edit.
Both the original image and the edited image are masked images since the image contains multiple objects and we want you to only focus on the intended object.

From a scale 0 to 10:
A score from 0 to 10 will be given based on the success of the editing.
- 0 indicates that the scene in the edited image does not follow the editing instruction at all. 
- 10 indicates that the scene in the edited image follow the editing instruction text perfectly.

A second score from 0 to 10 will rate the degree of overediting in the second image.
- 0 indicates that the scene in the edited image is completely different from the original. 
- 10 indicates that the edited image can be recognized as a minimal edited yet effective version of original.

Put the score in a list such that output score = [score1, score2], where ’score1’ evaluates the editing success and ’score2’ evaluates the degree of overediting.
