I need your assist extract some information from and image prompt and an editing prompt.
Image prompt is the prompt that describes the image and the editing prompts are the prompts that describe the image after the editing.
I need to create image generating prompt, editing objects, referring expressions from the prompt regarding editing objects, more descriptive referring expressions which are correct according to the written prompt and edit prompts as per the examples. Generate data only for one image. Follow the format exactly.
Now I already created image generating prompt and the editing prompt so you only have to create other elements. 

Start with the editing instruction. Check the difference between the prompt and the editing prompt to identify the editing instruction. But when you write it, it should be based on referring expressions where you pinpoint the object using relational attributes of other objects.
Editing object is the most basic object that is edited. 
Referring expression is the expression that refers to the object that is edited using some attributes of the object.
Descriptive referring expression uses all the information from the prompt to describe the object.
Descriptive referring expression for a single object is the singular form of the descriptive referring expression.

The given samples only focus on changing color of an object.

Use diverse editing instructions. Some examples are as follows.
	Let the color of the cars near the stall be red
    The hair of the girls with red purse should be brown
    Could the leftmost balls be white?
    Change the color of the nearest laptops to black
    The eyes of the men with umbrella should be blue
    Change the color of the flowers in the green vase to pink

Do not include the initial state of the editing object in the editing instruction.
    Change the color of the cars near the stall from green to red
    Change the eyes of the men with umbrella from black to brown
    Change the color of the flowers in the green vase from red to pink

[editing_instruction2]

**Editing object**
